# Local Mortality Dataset

This repository contains local-level data on all-cause mortality in 2015â€“2021.    
Local is any sub-national unit - whether state, province, region, city etc.   
Local Mortality is a sister-project of [World Mortality](https://github.com/akarlinsky/world_mortality), Priority is given to local mortality information from countries which are not present in World Mortality or have very partial information on World Mortality.   

Sources vary by local unit, see below.   
We are currently providing data for 18 Local Units from 10 Countries.   
We welcome any contributions.

Notes:

* Many of our sources come from news articles citing just a few data points per local unit - Data is most likely highly incomplete. Use with caution.
* For inclusion, we require at least one data point from 2020 onward and at least one data point prior to 2020.
* We only collect weekly, monthly, or quarterly data. 
* We only provide all-cause mortality numbers, without splitting by age or gender.
* For some Local Units we do not have raw data prior to 2020 but rather a mean or a forecast. We denote this as `year = 0` in the dataset.

## Syria

### Damascus (monthly)
[Watson et al. (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22474-9).

Watson et al. (2021) provides a host of information on mortality and excess mortality in Damascus. For our purposes, we used the [supplementary table 7](https://github.com/mrc-ide/syria-covid-ascertainment/blob/master/analysis/data/raw/supp_table_7_revised.csv) which collects information on on death certificates postered in Damascus from 2017. To transform these into TOTAL mortality in Damascus, the monthly counts were corrected by the coverage share of certificates (4152) to total deaths reported in Damascus by the Syrian NSO (10835) for 2019.

We advise users to treat this information and estimates with caution.
