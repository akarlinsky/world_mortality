# Preliminary Mortality Dataset

This repository contains preliminary data on all-cause mortality in 2015 onward, which doesn't fit into [World Mortality](https://github.com/akarlinsky/world_mortality) or [Local Mortality](https://github.com/akarlinsky/world_mortality/tree/main/local_mortality) for various reasons such as time format (not weekly, monthly or quarterly), un-official status, projections, early releases of more detailed data forthcoming, etc.
Each datum source, properties and limitations is listed below.
As the time format varies substantially, each source is provided as a separate csv file.

We advise not to use Preliminary Mortality for comparisons and analysis, as we cannot vet the reliability of these reports. It is a collection of disparate all-cause mortality reports from across the world.
 
Sources are listed below the figures. We welcome any contributions.
