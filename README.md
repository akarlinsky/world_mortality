# World Mortality Dataset

This repository contains country-level data on all-cause mortality in 2015–2022 collected from various sources, see below.   
We are currently providing data for 125 countries and territories.   
We welcome any contributions.

For the excess mortality analysis using this data see https://github.com/dkobak/excess-mortality.

For our sister-project of sub-national mortality data, see https://github.com/akarlinsky/world_mortality/tree/main/local_mortality

Notes:

* Our aim is to provide data from 2015 onward. In some cases the coverage starts later, but we require at least full 2019 data.
* Countries are only included if the data exist until at least June 2020. 
* We only collect weekly, monthly, or quarterly data. 
* The latest data points (weeks/months/quarters) for each country are **preliminary** and subject to (sometimes large) revisions.   
* We only provide all-cause mortality numbers, without splitting by age or gender.
* We only provide country-level data, without splitting it by regions or individual cities.
* The Short Term Mortality Fluctuations (STMF) dataset from the [Human Mortality Database](https://www.mortality.org/Data/STMF) (HMD) is integrated into this dataset. See the STMF dataset for mortality by age and gender; here we only provide the total numbers.
* The data for the European countries that are not in STMF are sourced from the [EuroStat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Weekly_death_statistics&stable).
* Some countries publish obviously incomplete weekly data for most recent weeks, which shows as large "dips" in the end of the time series. We omit these data points.  
* Weekly data mostly follow ISO8601 standard, when weeks are calendar weeks, Monday to Sunday, and the weeks on the year boundaries are assigned to the year in which they have more days (four or more). Most years have 52 weeks but some years, such as 2015 and 2020, have 53 weeks. Some countries follow other conventions, see e.g. [STMF description](https://www.mortality.org/Public/STMF_DOC/STMFNote.pdf).

## Sources

### Human Mortality Database, Short-Term Mortality Fluctuations
We collect the weekly [STMF data](https://mpidr.shinyapps.io/stmortality/) for the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Chile, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, South Korea, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom (England & Wales + Northern Ireland + Scotland).

We do not use Taiwan data from STMF because the monthly data (see below) is more frequently updated. 

For some European countries, STMF sometimes has more up-to-date (and backward revised) data than EuroStat, as it culls data from countries' NSOs. 
We harmonize the data between these two sources by defaulting to STMF wherever possible, and appending additional from Eurostat if available. 



### Eurostat
We collect the weekly data from Eurostat for the following countries: Cyprus, Malta, Montenegro, Romania: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/demo_r_mwk_ts/default/table?lang=en

Additionally, we collect weekly data from EuroStat for the five French Overseas Departments:

### Brazil (monthly)
2015 to 2022: Brazil Ministry of Health Sistema de Informação sobre Mortalidade (SIM): https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/dataset/sim

2022 August onward: Brazilian Civil Registry (RC): https://transparencia.registrocivil.org.br/registros  
In Brazil, the RC is the most up to date source of all-cause mortality. However, it is downward biased compared to the official final figures from SIM due to delayed registration.   
In order to account for this, the 2022 monthly counts from the RC are corrected using the ratio between total deaths in SIM 2020 (1,581,645) to total deaths in RC 2020 (1,475,561). 

Monthly deaths in Brazil that have been corrected for delayed registration were rounded to one significant digit to emphasize they were adjusted. When comprehensive SIM data is available, no correction is conducted.

StatCan has more up to date data than present in World Mortality, yet it is incomplete due to lack of reporting from Ontario (largest province). See: https://twitter.com/ArielKarlinsky/status/1383054708386959364/photo/1

Note: Since 2020, Kosovo's NSO has released monthly mortality data disaggregated by place of death, with a substantial share occurring outside Kosovo due to a large diaspora. Data from previous years is for deaths that occur in Kosovo only. Thus, for consistency - all values are for deaths that occur in Kosovo.

Currently, we provide the data from the Yearbook and are investigating if and how to adjust.

### Peru (weekly)
2017 onward: Peruvian Ministry of Health - National Deaths Registration System (SINADEF): https://www.minsa.gob.pe/reunis/data/defunciones_registradas.asp.

Peru provides daily death counts. We summed them up to form weekly death counts.

From July 1st 2022, we adjust SINADEF's figures to the total number of registered deaths in Peru using the ratio between it and Peru's stats office (INEI). The completeness rates are: 2017: 66%; 2018: 74%; 2019: 73%; 2020 onward: 94%. 
For more details see the [discussion in our repo](https://github.com/akarlinsky/world_mortality/issues/4#issuecomment-1166526485).
The adjusted deaths numbers were rounded to one significant digit to emphasize that they were adjusted.

### Russia (monthly)

For 2015--2021 we use monthly data by date of death, as obtained by us via an information request to [Rosstat](https://rosstat.gov.ru). The raw data contain a small fraction of deaths each year with an unknown month of date. We redistributed those deaths into individual months, proportionally to the deaths with the known month of death, so that the yearly sum equals the yearly sum reported by Rosstat. We provide the numbers with one decimal digit, to emphasize our procedure. We thank [Alexey Raksha](https://www.facebook.com/100001739601178) for the help with obtaining these data.

Starting with 2022, there are no data by date of death yet available, we we are using monthly data by death of registration. It can be found here https://www.fedstat.ru/indicator/33556. The latest month is published on https://rosstat.gov.ru first and it takes several weeks for the data to appear on https://www.fedstat.ru.

### Sweden (weekly)
Statistics Sweden - Preliminary Statistics on Deaths (2015 onward, daily):
https://scb.se/en/About-us/news-and-press-releases/follow-the-preliminary-statistics-on-deaths/.

Note: Sweden has a significant number of deaths which occurred in an "unknown" date (and thus week) in all years. However, 95% these have a [known month of death](https://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/pxweb/en/ssd/START__BE__BE0101__BE0101G/ManadFoddDod/). In order to account for this, we have adjusted the daily number of deaths in Sweden by the difference between monthly deaths from daily deaths and total monthly deaths, and the residual with unknown month, distributed throughout the year. 
For example, the sum of daily deaths in April 2020 is 10376. The total monthly deaths in April 2020 is 10555, which yields a daily mean difference of 5.97 added to each day in April 2020. The 254 additional deaths in 2020 with unknown month, were distributed uniformly across months and then daily within each month. Thus, each day in April 2020 is increased by 6.67 deaths.

Weekly deaths in Sweden have been rounded to one significant digit to emphasize they were adjusted.
